# Hello there 👋

I'm a Site Reliability Engineer and work on Linux and K8s systems administration, maintaining Infrastructure as Code and Configuration Management codebases. My day-to-day is focused on operations but I also develop in several languages for our tooling, like Terraform, Bash, Python, and Go.

I'm a seasoned systems engineer interested in software engineering. 
The scopes that motivate me the most are tooling, distributed systems, audio programming, and retro videogame consoles 👾.

When not in front of a computer I'd be creating music or training 🎸🏋️‍♂️.

- 🧐 Interested in Linux, FOSS, systems / low-level programming
- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my programming skills
- 🌱 I’m currently (re)learning C and Rust, and can't deny an interest in Assembly 😅
