I'm a Site Reliability Engineer at Algolia and work on Linux systems and K8s administration, maintaining Infrastructure as Code and Configuration Management codebases. My day-to-day is focused on operations but I also develop in several languages for our tooling, like Bash, Python, and Go.

I'm a seasoned systems engineer interested in software engineering. In my spare time I work on coding, the scopes that motivate me the most are tooling, distributed systems, audio programming, and retro videogame consoles. I am interested in Swift development for Apple products and Machine Learning as they are closely related to my motivations.

When not in front of a computer I'd be creating music or training 🎸🏋️‍♂️.
