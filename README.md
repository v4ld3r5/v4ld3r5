# Hello there 👋

I'm a Site Reliability Engineer and work on Linux and K8s systems administration, maintaining Infrastructure as Code and Configuration Management codebases. My day-to-day is focused on operations but I also develop in several languages for our tooling, like Terraform, Bash, Python, and Go.

I'm a seasoned systems engineer interested in software design and architecture.
The scopes that motivate me the most are tooling, distributed systems, low-level / embedded / systems code, and retro videogame consoles 👾.
My goals in 2025 include:
- Achieving a fluent level of Python, Go and Rust
- Master K8s as cluster operator and platform developer

When not in front of a computer I'd be creating music or training 🎸🏋️‍♂️.

- 🧐 Interested in Linux, FOSS, systems / low-level programming
- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my Software Engineering skills
- 🌱 I’m currently (re)learning C, Go and Rust, and can't deny an interest in Assembly 😅
